SEGMENT 1:
==========================================================================
## Measurability: 
The customer segment is subject to heavy research efforts
               by academics. A great deal of statistical data and scientific
               insights are availiable.
## Accessibility: 
Great reach through private healthcare enterprises. Well handled
               by recommender systems. If you buy meds online, search for a
               a therapist online or watch related videos, the recommender
               system will instantly spot you.
## Substantiality: 
4.1%-8.3% of adult population in CANZUK/US/EU!
## Responsiveness: 
Customers in this segment take such marketing offers very
                seriously.
## Differentiability: 
The segment has very distinct needs, and a number of 
                   peculiar attributes that the vast majority of it shares.
                   However there is a great diversity in age, income,
                   relationship status and supposedly aesthetical preferences.
                   The subsegments on the other hand tend to be more homogenous.
## Actionable: 
The nature of the segment makes the choice of adequate
            marketing measures abundantly clear. Mental wellness, hope, confidence, 
            control, peace of mind, ... -- the customer has a great demand for
            those. And if you can convince them that your product can 
            provide any of the above, then it's in the bag.

SEGMENT 2:
=========================================================================================
## Measurability: 
The customer segment is subject to both heavy monitoring
               by academics and auditing measures by their respective private
               enterprises. A great deal of ever evolving statistical data
               is availiable from this constant scrutiny and monitoring.
## Accessibility: 
Great reach through private healthcare enterprises. Well handled
               by recommender systems. Therapists regularly do a lot of stuff 
               online that reveals their occupation.
## Substantiality: 
If we reach this segment, we automatically reach SEGMENT 1. 
                1 reached therapist = 100 reached patients.
## Responsiveness: 
Customers in this segment take such marketing offers, 
                seriously, since those offers may have objective monetary value.
## Differentiability: 
A concrete occupation that also happens to be
                   homogenous in a number of aspects: age, views, income, 
                   education and even gender (although to a lesser degree). 
## Actionable: 
The segment mostly consists of people, who can be targeted
            as platform providers or as secondary users. They have a paragmatic
            mindset regarding services that can potentially enhance the product
            of their labour. As long as we can convince them that our product 
            will produce some value for their business, they will become our
            customers or will greatly contribute to the sales of our product.
