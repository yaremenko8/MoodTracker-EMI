## Slogan

``Let's improve your mood together``

#### Rationale:
* Reflects that the product is intended to provide benefits to mental health, which is the core need identified within "SEGMENT 1".
* Captures the ease and confidence with which the improvement will be achieved. As described in "Segment Identification", the customer from "SEGMENT 1" has the need for certainty and also the need for peace of mind. The harsh reality of combating mental illness is often perceived as a struggle. By using this nonchallant tone to decribe the process of improving your mental health through a therapeutic measure we create the impression that one won't have to struggle, while doing so, which is exactly the value that we intend to provide. 
* Using the word "together" creates a sesnse that we are here to support them and we too are invested in the result. This contrasts how mental healthcare delivery professionals often avoid making any promisses and often are reluctant to provide a definite answer to questions like "is this going to help me?" and "how long do I have to wait till I feel better?" almost as if they were trying to evade any kind of responsibility.
* The word "together" may also suggest the participation of a therapist. If a "customer" from "SEGMENT 2" were to read the slogan in first person, that would sound like an inspiring proposition that they can make.
