## Slogan

``Let's improve your mood together``

#### Rationale:
* Captures the ease and certainity with which the improvement will be achieved. As described in "Segment Identification", the customer has the need for certainty and also a need for peace of mind. The harsh reality of combating mental illness is often perceived as a struggle. By using this nonchallant tone to decribe the process of improving your mental health through a therapeutic measure we create the impression that one won't have to struggle, while doing so, which is exactly the value that we intend to provide. 
* Using the word "together" creates a sesnse that we are here to support them and we too are invested in the result.
