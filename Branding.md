## Slogan

``Let's improve your mood together``

#### Rationale:
* Captures the ease and certainity with which the improvement will be achieved. As described in "Segment Identification", the customer has the need for certainty and also the need for peace of mind. The harsh reality of combating mental illness is often perceived as a struggle. By using this nonchallant tone to decribe the process of improving your mental health through a therapeutic measure we create the impression that one won't have to struggle, while doing so, which is exactly the value that we intend to provide. 
* Using the word "together" creates a sesnse that we are here to support them and we too are invested in the result.
