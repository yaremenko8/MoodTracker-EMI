A mood diary is a highly descriptive log of ones mood, emotions, joys, fears and stress as well the thoughts or events that invoked them. A mood diary 
is an important therapeutic tool in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, a kind of verbal therapy that is nowadays very commonly used to treat and ease the
symptoms of a wide array of mental disorders. Such diaries are used to analyze and improve habbits, perceptions, behaviors and thinking patterns. We propose a mobile application that can act as a digital mood diary. 

Our vision is "An app that provides powerful means to improve one's life."

Our mission is "To provide a significantly more comfortable experience of maintaining a mood diary and to boost its usefulness.".

A couple of words about our intended brand experience:

The sensory experience is supposed to be smooth, gentle and tender.

The affective experience is meant to involve peace, confidence, control, comfort and affirmation.

From the behavioral standpoint we have consistency, order and proactivity.

And the associated intellectual experience would have a lot to do with how one
would use those observations to eliminate stress patterns in their day to day life, 
... which is in essence what mood diaries are for other than for diagnostics.

Our slogan is "Let's improve your mood together". 
The slogan is inteded to reflect that our product radiates confidence, commitment and affirmation.
