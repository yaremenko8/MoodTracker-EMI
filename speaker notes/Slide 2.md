Most patients find the process of maintaing a mood diary to be tedious, burdensome and generally hard to properly 
comply with.

At the same time therapists have a pain of their own. Analyzing entries to locate important ones may become a time consuming process. 
The longer it takes to go through the diary, the less time remains to discuss the observations.

So, here are our target segments.

----------------------------------------------------

SEGMENT 1: CBT patients.

People in this segment live in the core anglosphere in urban/suburban areas.
They have either life insurance or at least middle income.
They suffer from one of the six most common mental disorders. 
Such people comprise 1% to 6% of adult population.

-----------------------------------------------------

SEGMENT 2: CBT providers.

Once again: urban/suburban area in the core anglosphere. 
They are educated, 30 years of age or older with lower middle to true middle income.
Among them are Innovators, Thinkers and Strivers that are liberal/left-wing or centrist.


Both segments are easy to reach via healthcare enterprises and recommendation systems.
Both segments are under heavy monitoring by academics.

## Timing
```
rushed: 44s (there is probably no way to improve it beyond this)
