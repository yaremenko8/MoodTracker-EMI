Most patients find the process of maintaing a mood diary to be tedious, burdensome and generally hard to properly 
comply with.

At the same time therapists have a pain of their own. Analyzing entries to locate important ones may become a time consuming process. 
The longer it takes to go through the diary, the less time remains to discuss the observations.

So, here are our target segments.

----------------------------------------------------

SEGMENT 1: CBT patients from core anglosphere and Europe.

People in this segment are mostly white, mostly female, living in urban/suburban areas and socially aware. 
Almost all of them have one of the six most common mental disorders. 
They comprise 1% to 6% of adult population.

-----------------------------------------------------

SEGMENT 2: Private CBT providers in those very same countries.

Once again: urban/suburban area, mostly white, mostly female. They are educated,
socially aware, 36 years of age or older, non-rightwing, non-conservative. 

Both segments are easy to reach via healthcare enterprises and recommendation systems.
Both segments are under heavy monitoring by academics.

rushed: 44s (there is probably no way to improve it beyond this)
