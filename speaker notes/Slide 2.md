Mood diaries are invaluable as both diagnostic and therapeutic tools, however most patients
find the process of maintaing a mood diary to be tedious, burdensome and generally hard to properly 
comply with in the long term. For example, to a person with depression such an activity will just become
another chore that they fail to complete due to the incapacitating lack of energy and desire.

At the same time therapists have a pain of their own. When a mood diary is being maintained properly, analyzing it 
and locating important entries may become a time consuming process, which becomes even more dragged on if their patient sees 
them on a bi-weekly basis. The longer it takes to go through the diary, the less time remains to discuss
the observations. This situation is unfortunate for both the therapist and the patient.

So, here are our target segments.

----------------------------------------------------

SEGMENT 1: CBT patients in Canada, US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and European Union.

People in this segment are mostly white, mostly female, they live in urban and suburban areas, they tend to be socially aware,
and they are diverse in age, income and relationship status. Almost all of them have either Depression, Addiction, OCD, PTSD, 
Anxiety or Eating disorders. They comprise 1% to 6% of the adult population in these countries.

Easilly reached via their healthcare provider and recommendation systems.

-----------------------------------------------------

SEGMENT 2: CBT providers in those very same countries.

In this segment we once again have people from an urban or suburban area that are mostly white and mostly female. They are educated,
socially aware, mostly 36 years of age or older, almost all of them are left-wing, liberal or centrist. This segment is smaller than segment 1,
but reaching a single person from segment 2, means reaching a 100 people from segment 1. 88% of them work in the private sector.

Easilly reached via their employer and recommendation systems.


Both segments are attractive.
