So, hello everyone. We're about to tell you about MoodTracker, our app that allows people to conveniently maintain a mood diary.

A mood diary is a highly descriptive log of ones mood, emotions, joys, fears and stress as 
well the thoughts or events that invoked them. A mood diary 
is an important therapeutic tool in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, a kind of verbal therapy 
that is nowadays very commonly used to treat and ease the
symptoms of a wide array of mental disorders. Such diaries are used to analyze and improve 
habbits, perceptions, behaviors and thinking patterns. We propose a mobile application 
that can act as a digital mood diary. (move to slide 0?)
